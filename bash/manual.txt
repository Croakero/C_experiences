Simply documents some shell commands so that I would not forget them.
我发现命令解析的时候， -之后的部分可以随意安排，不加-的部分也有说法，似乎那些程序会很聪明地解析命令行参数

ls to list all files in a ddirectory or list some propreties of a file

-l use a long listing format
-t sort by time, newest first
-R recursively

ls ./ -Rlt
ls -l sample.txt

chmod to change the access permissions of a file or directory.

-R change files and directories recursively
The letters rwxXst select file mode bits for the affected users: read(r), write(w), execute (or search for directories) (x), execute/search only if the file is a directory or already has execute permission for some user (X), set user or group ID on execution (s)
chmod -R a+x ./
is to recursively add execute right to all users of all files from this directory.

mv rename SOURCE to DEST, or move SOURCE to DIRECTORY.

mv sample.txt example.txt 
is to rename sample.txt to example.txt

cd change the current working directory.

cd .. 
to go to the parent of the cuurent directory

cd /
to go to the root directory

cd ~
to go to the home directory of the current user

cd -
to go to the previously chosen directory

pipe and redirection

use a | b to redirect the output of a to the imput of b
use >> means stdout but in amplify mod
use > redirects stdout
use 2> redirects stderr

echo to print its arguments on stdout
$0 filename
$1~$9 arguments
$# argc
$_ last argument of the last command
$? return value of the last command
$$ pid
!! think of sudo !!

find  search for files in a directory hierarchy
-name '*.txt'
is to find out all files with a extension of .txt
-path '**/path/**'
is to find files mathcing multiple path patterns
-type d -iname 'balabala'
is to find directions matching a given name, in not case-sensitive mode
-exec rm {} \
is to remove all files that are found.
!!!!!!!!!!!!DO NOT FORGET THE DOT AFTER "find"
!!!!!!!!!!!!DO NOT FORGET THE "" OR '' IN NAME,PATH and so on.

Why using -print0


grep searches for PATTERNS in each file.
Eurika!My dent is not knowing how to use grep!

-r
recursively,not -R! -R is used in chmod and ls
grep hello file.txt
find "hello" in file.txt
grep -r -n pattern dir/
to find all lines in files of dir/ that matches the regex pattern
